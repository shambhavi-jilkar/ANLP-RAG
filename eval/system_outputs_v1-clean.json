Context: Carnegie Mellon University\nCarnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a private research university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The institution was established in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie as the Carnegie Technical Schools. In 1912, it became the Carnegie Institute of Technology and began granting four-year degrees. In 1967, it became Carnegie Mellon University through its merger with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, founded in 1913 by Andrew Mellon and Richard B. Mellon and formerly a part of the University of Pittsburgh.[11]\nThe university consists of seven colleges, including the College of Engineering, the School of Computer Science, and the Tepper School of Business.[12] The university has its main campus located 5 miles (8 km) from downtown Pittsburgh. It also has over a dozen degree-granting locations in six continents, including campuses in Qatar, Silicon Valley, and Kigali, Rwanda (Carnegie Mellon University Africa) and partnerships with universities nationally and globally.[13] Carnegie Mellon enrolls 15,818 students across its multiple campuses from 117 countries and employs more than 1,400 faculty members.[14]\nCarnegie Mellon is known for its advances in research and new fields of study, home to many firsts in computer science (including the first machine learning, robotics, and computational biology departments), pioneering the field of management science,[15] and the first drama program in the United States. Carnegie Mellon is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[16]\nCarnegie Mellon competes in NCAA Division III athletics as a founding member of the University Athletic Association. Carnegie Mellon fields eight men's teams and nine women's teams as the Tartans.[17] The university's faculty and alumni include 21 Nobel Prize laureates and 13 Turing Award winners and have received 142 Emmy Awards, 64 Tony Awards, and 13 Academy Awards.[18] Carnegie Mellon is ranked #26 in the US News & World Report Best Colleges Rankings 2022/2023.[19]\nCarnegi",

Context: Pittsburgh Steelers Community Relations Mission Statement\nPittsburgh Steelers Community Relations Mission Statement\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers are proud to be a part of the Western Pennsylvania community. The organization's strong commitment to this area dates back to 1933 when Arthur J. Rooney, Sr. founded the team. Current President Art Rooney II is known as one of the most active NFL owners and one of Pittsburgh's most involved executives in civic affairs, as was his father, the late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney. Steelers players, coaches and front office staff are involved in appearances, charitable donations and outreach programs with nonprofit and community groups. It's our way of giving back to the community that has given us so much!\n\nSuper Steelers\nDiscover the history behind the Steelers dynasty and celebrate the team’s six Super Bowl championships.\nProfessional football traces its roots to Pittsburgh when in 1892, the Allegheny Athletic Association football team paid former Yale University All-American guard Pudge William “Pudge” Heffelfinger $500 to play against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Forty years later, Art Rooney Sr. founded Pittsburgh’s first professional franchise, first known as the Pirates and later renamed the Steelers. Today, the Steelers’ six Super Bowl trophies are tied for the most among any NFL team, helping to secure an unmatched legacy of professional football in Pittsburgh.\n\nFootball\nThe city's professional team, NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, is named after the distribution company the Pittsburgh Steeling company established in 1927. News of the team has preempted news of elections and other events and are important to the region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises.[207] The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.[208] The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super Bowl in 2009.\nCollege football in the city dates to 1889[209] with the Division I (FBS) Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships, qualifying 37 total bowl games, appearing in the 2018 ACC Championship Game, and winnin",
